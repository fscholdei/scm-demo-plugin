# scm-demo-plugin

Before it was possible to deliver the styleguide separately during development, this plugin was used to support.

Now there exists a SCM-Manager styleguide which can support you build fitting and beautiful ui components. Find the styleguide in [`scm-ui/ui-styles`](https://github.com/scm-manager/scm-manager/tree/develop/scm-ui/ui-styles).
